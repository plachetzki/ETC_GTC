### To generate figures and statistical tables:

1. Execute 01_EGind4.R and 01_ESind1.R to generate stat tables and PDF for each species.

2. Re-execute  01_EGind4.R and 01_ESind1.R, this will generate PDFs in which the 
phylogenies are pruned of insignficant tips from the other species, using the 
previously generated stat table.

3. Execute 02_fulltrees.R to generate the Final figures.
